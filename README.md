# Assembly Endgame

## Project Description
Assembly Endgame is a React-based interactive game that challenges players to guess a word. Each incorrect guess results in a programming language being eliminated from a displayed list. The goal is to guess the correct word before all the programming languages are eliminated and end  up with only assembly lanhuage.

This project was developed as part of the Scrimba React course to practice and reinforce React concepts, including state management, event handling, and rendering dynamic components.
